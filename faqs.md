# SNAP Photo FAQ

## What do I need to bring to picture day?
All you need is your athlete and any equipment you'd normally bring (bats, gloves, sticks, Soccer Balls, etc.). Each player will receive a Photo Ticket at check-in, which they'll hand to the photographer before getting their photo taken.
If your athlete or coach is involved with multiple teams, please bring the correct jersey for each team and let the SNAP! check-in representative know. Separate photos are required for each team.

## I can’t make my team’s scheduled time. What are my options?
Please contact us ahead of time at 215-256-9151. We’re happy to offer an alternate time slot if possible. 
If you can’t make it to picture day at all, we can schedule a makeup session at our studio in Harleysville or if available another local photo shoot.

## Do coaches need to have their photo taken?
Yes. Coaches are photographed individually so they can be included in the final team photo layout. 
**IMPORTANT: If you coach multiple teams, you must have your photo taken separately for each team. This can be done during the same session, but please inform our staff at the photo check-in table that you coach more than one team.**
